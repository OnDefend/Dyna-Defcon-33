DrozerHelper: Drozer connection management with error handling

This module provides a helper class for interacting with the Drozer Android security
testing framework with error handling, graceful degradation, and retry logic
to prevent incomplete analysis when Drozer is unavailable or unstable.

Features:
- Graceful degradation when Drozer is unavailable
- Retry logic for transient connection issues
- Reduced timeouts to prevent hanging
- Error handling without hard exits
- Connection state management and recovery
